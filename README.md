## Recent Projects
### Automatidata - NYC Taxi (Multiple Linear Regression)
[View Project](https://github.com/am-docs/projects/tree/main/automatidata/automatidata_linear_reg.ipynb)

Developed a **multiple linear regression** model in **Python** to predict NYC taxi fare amounts based on trip data collected over a one-year period. Conducted exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and A/B testing to refine features and validate assumptions. The model incorporated variables such as trip distance, time of day, and passenger count to estimate fare pricing with improved accuracy. This analysis provided the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) with a data-driven tool to better understand fare dynamics and support future pricing strategies.

### Tik Tok Project (Logistic Regression)
[View Project](https://github.com/am-docs/projects/tree/main/tik_tok/tik_tok_project.ipynb)

Conducted logistic regression analysis in Python to explore the relationship between video features and user verification status on TikTok. The project aimed to support the development of a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between claim-based and opinion-based content. Through exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and feature engineering, the model identified key predictors of verification status, such as engagement metrics and content characteristics.

## Micro Projects
### Interactive Performance Dashboard (Tableau)
[View Project](https://public.tableau.com/views/InteractivePerformanceDashboard_17502559031740/PerformanceDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Designed an interactive dashboard in **Tableau** to visualize and analyze sales performance using the Superstore dataset. The dashboard integrates key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, profit, and order quantity, segmented by region, category, and sub-category. By incorporating dynamic filters and drill-down capabilities, the tool enables users to explore trends, identify underperforming segments, and monitor profitability across product lines and geographies. This solution empowers business stakeholders with actionable insights to support data-informed decisions around inventory, marketing, and strategic planning.

### Multiple Linear Regression
[View Project](https://github.com/am-docs/projects/tree/main/mul_lin_reg/multiple linear regression.ipynb)

Analyzed the impact of multiple marketing promotions on sales using a multiple linear regression model in **Python**, leveraging packages like **statsmodels** and **seaborn**. The analysis identified statistically significant predictors and quantified their effects on sales, revealing that certain promotional types drove up to 30% more sales than others. This data-driven approach provided actionable insights for optimizing marketing spend and enabled stakeholders to make evidence-based campaign decisions.

### Hypothesis Testing (ANOVA)
[View Project](https://github.com/am-docs/projects/tree/main/hypothesis_testing/hypothesis_testing.ipynb)

Applied a one-way **ANOVA** and **post hoc tests** to determine whether significant differences existed among promotion types. This approach provided clear evidence of variation in promotional effectiveness between groups, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven budget allocation decisions. The analysis combined visualizations, model validation, and plain-language interpretation to support actionable business insights.

### Logistic Regression
[View Project](https://github.com/am-docs/projects/tree/main/logistic_reg/logistic_regression.ipynb)

Constructed a **binomial logistic regression** model using Python to predict customer satisfaction based on in-flight entertainment ratings and related flight experience data. Conducted exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and transformation on a dataset of over 129,000 airline passengers. The model evaluated the likelihood of customer satisfaction using one key predictor, and was assessed using a **confusion matrix** to validate accuracy. This project demonstrated the practical application of logistic regression for binary classification and provided actionable insights to improve customer experience strategy in the airline industry.

### Gaussian Naives Bayes
[View Project](https://github.com/am-docs/projects/tree/main/nba/nba_naives_bayes.ipynb)

Developed a **supervised machine learning** model to determine whether an NBA player is likely to have a career lasting five years or more. This initiative supported the league’s interest of identifying and retaining athletes who can thrive in a high-pressure, long-term professional environment. After conducting exploratory analysis and feature engineering on NBA player performance data, we identified key variables that contribute to career longevity. These insights were applied to train a classification model that can help predict long-term player success.

### Hotel Reservations Data Exploration (SQL)
[View Project](https://github.com/am-docs/projects/tree/main/hotel_reservations_SQL/hotel_reservations.sql)

Performed comprehensive data exploration using SQL to analyze hotel reservation patterns and guest behavior. The objective was to uncover insights that could inform pricing strategy, cancellation policies, and guest segmentation. Leveraged advanced **SQL skills including joins, CTEs, temp tables, window functions, aggregate functions, data type conversions**, and **views** to clean, transform, and structure the reservation data. This type of analysis enables the identification of key trends such as booking lead time, guest composition, and cancellation revenue, which support more data-driven decision-making in hotel revenue management.
