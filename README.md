## Portfolio Projects
### Marketing Promotion Analysis using Multiple Linear Regression
[View Project](https://github.com/am-docs/projects/tree/main/mul_lin_reg)

Analyzed the impact of multiple marketing promotions on sales using a multiple linear regression model in **Python**, leveraging packages like **statsmodels** and **seaborn**. The analysis identified statistically significant predictors and quantified their effects on sales, revealing that certain promotional types drove up to 30% more sales than others. This data-driven approach provided actionable insights for optimizing marketing spend and enabled stakeholders to make evidence-based campaign decisions.

### Hypothesis Testing (ANOVA)
[View Project](https://github.com/am-docs/projects/tree/main/hypothesis_testing)

Applied a one-way **ANOVA** and **post hoc tests** to determine whether significant differences existed among promotion types. This approach provided clear evidence of variation in promotional effectiveness between groups, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven budget allocation decisions. The analysis combined visualizations, model validation, and plain-language interpretation to support actionable business insights.
